# Readme Generator

This simple script generates a README file for your project using the `gorav-readme-generator` package.

## Installation

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn, pnpm) installed.

```bash
npm install gorav-readme-generator
```

## Usage

1. Create a `script.js` file (or modify an existing one) with the following code:

```javascript
import { generateReadme } from "gorav-readme-generator/index.js";
generateReadme();
```

2. Run the script:

```bash
node script.js
```

This will generate a `README.md` file in the current directory. You can then customize the generated README further to fit your project's specific details.


## Note

This script utilizes the `gorav-readme-generator` package, which may require additional configuration or input depending on its specific functionality.  Refer to the package's documentation for further details.  It's recommended to review and edit the generated README to ensure accuracy and completeness.
