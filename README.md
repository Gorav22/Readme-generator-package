# Gemini-Powered README Generator

This project automates the generation of README.md files using Google's Gemini API.  It analyzes your project's codebase to infer project details like the project name, description, installation steps, tech stack, features, and more, then uses this information to create a comprehensive README.

## Setup and Installation

### Pre-Requisites

* Node.js (v16 or above)
* A Google Cloud Project with the Gemini API enabled
* An API key for the Gemini API

### Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repository`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Set up your Gemini API key:
    * Create a `.env` file in the project root.
    * Add your API key to the `.env` file: `API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY`

### Environment Variables

The project relies on the following environment variable:

```
API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY  // Your Google Gemini API Key
```

## Tech Stack

### Backend

* Node.js
* Google Gemini API
* `fs-extra` (for file system operations)
* `glob` (for file pattern matching)


## Features

* Analyzes code files (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python) to understand project structure and functionality.
* Generates a README.md file with sections for project description, installation instructions, environment variables, tech stack, features, contributing guidelines, and license.
* Uses the Gemini API for code analysis and README content generation.
* Ignores common directories like `node_modules`, `dist`, and `build` during code analysis.
